# Bubblegram

This project is a major refactoring of an old 2002 Java AWT Bubble Diagramming 
software. It wasn't even working when I started, but I got the basic fixes needed 
to make it work into the code. Now I'm working on getting the code into usable shape, 
and remove some of the issues with the lack of separation of concerns.

I am making these changes so that I can integrate it into Mymud (https://mymud.io) for
a tool to make area and room creation easier for admins.

For a simple view of what this API can do, run the GLPanel class's main() method.
